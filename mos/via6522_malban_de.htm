<p>Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA)</p>

<p>It is essential to gain a full understanding of the 6522 chip
if it is to be emulated as in the recent BBC and VIC-20
emulators. At first it all seems a bit complicated but after a
while things will start to make sense and you'll appreciate how
powerful and versatile this chip was in it's day. I have included
all the information I have on the 6522 in this document. </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION </p>

<p>The R6522 VIA adds two powerful, flexible interval timers, a
serial-to -parallel:parallel-to-serial shift register and input
latching on the peripheral ports. Handshaking capability is
expanded to allow control of bidirectional data transfers between
VIAs in multiple processor systems and between periherals. </p>

<p>Control of peripherals is primarily through two 8-bit
bidirectional ports. Each of these ports can be programmed to act
as an input or and output. Peripheral I/O lines can be
selectively controlled by the Interval Timers to generate
programmable frequency square waves and/or to count externally
generated pulses. Positive control of VIA functions is gained
through its internal register organisation: Interrupt Flag
Register, Interrupt Enable Register, and two Funtion Control
Registers. </p>

<p>FEATURES </p>

<ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>are the control lines which are used for a wide range of

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONTROL LINES</p>

<p>The control lines are now discussed in more detail. These
lines can act as interrupt inputs or handshake outputs. They can
perform a number of different functions determined by the
Peripheral Control Register (PCR). CA2 and CB2 can act as inputs
or outputs in a number or modes discussed later, whereas CA1 and
CB1 can only act as inputs. As an example, the VIC-20 uses the
controls lines for events such as the restore key being pushed,
received serial data, and outputs such as turning the cassette
motor on. </p>

<p>VIA INTERNAL REGISTERS </p>

<p>One VIA chip has 16 internal registers used to control its
many features. These registers occupy 16 consecutive addresses in
RAM. The following table gives the offsets of each VIA register.
All registers are 8-bit: </p>

<p>Register Designation Function offset no. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>0 ORA or IRB Output or input register B<br>
    1 ORA or IRA Output or input register A<br>
    2 DDRB Data direction register B<br>
    3 DDRA Data direction register A<br>
    4 T1C-L T1 low-byte latch or T1 low-byte counter<br>
    5 T1C-H T1 high-byte counter<br>
    6 T1L-L T1 low-byte latch<br>
    7 T1L-H T1 high-byte latch<br>

    13 IFR Interrupt Flag Register<br>
    14 IER Interrupt Enable Register<br>
    15 ORA or IRA Identical to offset 1 but no handshake</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will now go through each of these registers in turn.</p>

<p>ORB/IRB : OUTPUT REGISTER B/INPUT REGISTER B</p>

<p>This is the first of the peripheral ports called port B. Most
communication to external peripherals is done through one of the
two 8-bit ports. Each of the 8 pins making up the ORB/IRA port
can be set to be an input or an output. DDRB, discussed later,
defines the directivity of ORB/IRB. If a data line is programmed
as an output in the DDRB, then the corresponding bit in the ORB
IRB register decides the logic on the data line. On the
otherhand, if a line is programmed as an input, the logic state
received from a device on that line is entred into the IRB. If a
line is programmed as an input, then any attempt to write into
that line via ORB is ignored. </p>

<p>ORA/IRA : OUTPUT REGISTER A/INPUT REGISTER A </p>

<p>Smilar to ORB/IRB above. </p>

<p>DDRB/DDRA : DATA DIRECTION REGISTERS </p>

<p>These registers determine the direction of each port pin. The
eight bits in a data direction register correspond to the eight
bits in the port registers and are interpreted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A '1' defines the corresponding pin as an ouput. <br>
    A '0' defines the corresponding pin as an input.<br>
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>THE TIMERS AND COUNTERS</p>

<p>It is always possible to generate delays (time intervals) by
loading one or more of the 6502 instruction registers with the
desired delay number and counting down to zero. This is not
always satisfactory because it ties up the computer. To provide
for independent delays and various other pulse counting
operations, the VIA is equipped with a variety of timers,
counters and latches. They are useful for generating interrupts
at regular intervals, triggering external devices or simulating a
real-time environment. The two timers, T1 and T2, are essentially
16-bit counters. Each counter occupies two consecutive addresses
(low and hign byte) but T1, the more complex of the two, has an
associated 16-bit latch, consequently occupying a further two
addresses, Before treating the tiners in detail, it is useful to
begin with an overview of the possibilities on offer. </p>

<p>(1) They may be read or written into as six memory locations,
four for T1 and two for T2. (See the VIA addresses given earlier
in this chapter). </p>

<p>(2) Their respective operation modes are governed by bits 5, 6
and 7 of the Auxiliary Control Register. </p>

<p>(3) Their status, at any time during the counting phase, is
obtainable by examining bits 5 and 6 in the IFR. By 'status' we
mean whether or not programmed interval has ended (time out). </p>

<p>(4) To generate a single time interval, a timer is loaded with
the number of clock pulses required (to generate that interval). </p>

<p>(5) Pulses arriving on PB6 can be counted until they compare
with a previously loaded number (T2 only). The normal use of PB6
as one of the eight data lines is, of course, suspended. </p>

<p>(6) T1 can be used to provide continuous time intervals. The
time interval between pulses will depend on a previously loaded
number. </p>

<p>(7) A single, or continuous series of pulses can be produced
on PB7; the pulse width will be dependent on a previously loaded
number. In this mode, PB7 will not be available as a normal data
line. </p>

<p>THE T2 TIMER</p>

<p>It is clear from the above overview that T2 is more simple
than T1. It can only generate simple time intervals or count
pulses arriving on PB6. Bit 5 of the ACR determines whether the
counter is decremented by the 6502 system clock or input pulses
arriving on PB6. </p>

<p>Counter High : T2C-H Counter Low : T2C-L </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The low-byte address of T2 is used to write or read the
low-order byte of the delay number. The T2 interrupt flag is
automatically cleared on a read action. The high-byte address is
used to write or read the high-byte of the number. Writing to
this address completes the timer loading, clears the T2 interrupt
flag and start the timing operation. On completion of the timing
interval, the T2 interrupt flag is set (bit 5 of IFR). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>THE T1 TIMER </p>

<p>This timer has a 16-bit latch as well as the normal 16-bit
counter. It is also possible to generate an output on PB7. There
are four different operating modes, depending on bits 6 and 7 in
the ACR. The choice is single-shot or free-running mode (bit 6)
and enable or disable PB7 (bit 7). Bit 7=0 will disable PB7
output. Bit 7=1 will enable PB7 output. Bit 6=0 is one shot mode.
Bit 6=1 is free-running mode. The addressing details and the
start and finish of timing are virtually the same as described
under T2 apart form the different addresses and bit 6, instead of
bit 5, for the interrupt flag in the IFR. The free-running mode
is made possible by the provision of a separate 16-bit latch in
the usual low-byte (T1L), high-byte (T1H) form. These occupy two
separate addresses. It is possible, therefore, to read or write
into the latches without affecting the associated timer count. In
the free-running mode, the number in the latches is automatically
re-entered into the timer again and the count restarted. This
makes it possible to generate a wave form of any mark to space
ratio on PB7. This is because the logic level (HIGH or LOW) on
PB7 remains fixed within a timing interval but inverts to the
opposite state during the next interval and so on. </p>

<p>Offset 4:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Write T1L-L; Read T1C-L. Clear interrupt flag. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Offset 5:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Write T1L-H and T1C-H. Transfer T1L-L to T1C-L. Clear
    interrupt flag. Start thetimer. Read T1C-H. </p>

<p>SR : SHIFT REGISTER</p>

<p>This register is more suited for serial data transmission.
Bits 2, 3, and 4 in the ACR determine the behaviour of the SR as
follows: </p>

</pre>

<p>The only feature of the ACR that hasn't been mentioned yet is
the latching mentioned above for bit 0 and bit 1. There are two
variations of input behaviour for Port A and Port B depending on
whether latching is enabled or disabled. If latching is disabled,
the level present at an input (i.e. the relevant PB or PA pin) is
read into IRB or IRA respecitively. If the latch is enabled, the
level read into IRB is that which existed after the 'last active
transition' arriving on CB1 (when a pulse of the correct phasing
and shape hit CB1 input). In other words, if the conditions
existing now are required, then latch must be in the disabled
condition. We only enable latching if we require CB1 to act as a
data-valid signal and we wish to ignore levels arriving after the
latching. </p>

<p>PCR : PERIPHERAL CONTROL REGISTER</p>

<p>The function of the various bits in the PCR depends on whether
CB2, and CA2 are inputs or outputs. This is the reason we have
two diagrams below. Note: CB1 and CA1 are always inputs. </p>

<p>PCR IN MORE DETAIL</p>

<p>We will now define a few of the terms used above. When mention
is made of the 'active edge', it refers to the setting of the
appropriate flag in another register (IFR). That is to say, the
only indication that an acceptable pulse has appeared on CB1,
CB2, CA1 or CA2 input is the setting of the appropriate flag. The
terms 'normal' and 'independent' apply only to CB2 and CA2 and,
even then, only when they are inputs. These terms concern the
conditions under which the CB2/CA2 flag is reset after it has
been set. In normal mode, the flag remains set until a READ or
WRITE instruction on the relevant data input/output port. For
example, for CB2 it would be ORB/IRB. This is most likely down
with an LDA or STA. In the independent mode, once a flag is set,
READ or WRITE does not reset it. </p>

<p>We will now discuss the behaviour of CB2 and CA2 when they are
outputs. For simplicity I will refer to CB2 only since CA2
operates identically. Clearly the significance of bits 6 and 5 is
completely different as can be seen in the diagrams above. </p>

<p>Handshake mode: <br>
CB2 goes LOW by a write operation on ORB and goes HIGH again on
an active transition of the CB1 input signal. </p>

<p>Pulse output mode: <br>
A negative-going pulse (goes from HIGH down to LOW then back
again) is emitted following a write operation on ORB. Ideal for
gadgetry which is activated by a negative-going pulse. </p>

<p>Manual mode: <br>
So called because both levels output on CB2 must be directly
programmed. The level on CB2 depends on bit 5. If bit 5 is 0, CB2
remains LOW. If bit 5 is 1, then CB2 is HIGH. In other words,
providing bit 6 remains at 1, CB2 mirrors the state of bit 5.</p>

<p>IFR : INTERRUPT FLAG REGISTER</p>

<p>When a signal arrives on CB1, CB2, CA1, or CA2 (when CB2 and
CA2 are inputs) it sets the appropriate flag to 1 in the IFR. The
significance of each bit in the IFR is as follows: </p>

</pre>

<p>It is possible, and sometimes desirable, to clear directly one
or more of the flags in the IFR. This is done (rather strangely)
by writing '1's into the flag positions to be cleared. Direct
clearing in this manner will normally be required when the
control line inputs are being used for purposes other than 6502
involvement - inparticular, when using the manual mode (refer
back to PCR). Bit 7 is the general interrupt status and is the
only flag which cannot be reset (or set) directly. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>IER : INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER</p>

<p>The bits in this register correspond exactly as describe above
for the IFR register. It represents a last ditch stand between
the various interrupt request sources and the 6502 IRQ input pin.
For example, there may have been and active signal arriving on,
say, CB1. This will have set the CB1 flag in the IFR. However,
there may already be another flag or flags set. The 6502 can only
accept one interrupt at a time so there is clearly a need for
higher status register which can be programmed to select which
flag is to be recognised (enabled). This is the role of the IER.
It operates as follows: </p>

<p>Bit 7:<br>
Like bit 7 in the IFR, this bit is special.<br>
When bit 7 = 0: Each 1 in a bit poisition is cleared (disabled).<br>
When bit 7 = 1: Each 1 in a bit position enables that bit.<br>
(Zeros in bit positions are left unchanged)</p>

<p>This isn't so easy to understand. Here are some examples which
may help:</p>

<p>(1) Enable CB1 interrupt and disable all others:</p>

<pre>LDA #&amp;6F 	\0110 1111
STA IER 	\Bit 7 = 0 so 1's disabled
LDA #&amp;90 	\1001 0000
STA IER 	\Bit 7 = 1 so bit-4 enabled
</pre>

<p>Note that the second pattern is the logical complement of the
first. This is not a coincidence.</p>

<p>(2) Enable Timer 1, disable the rest and then clear the T1
flag bit in the IFR.</p>

<pre>LDA #&amp;3F	 \Disable all others
STA IER
LDA #&amp;C0	 \1100 0000 to enable T1
STA IER
STA IFR		 \Reset T1 flag in IFR
</pre>

<pre>ORA\IRA 	: NO HANDSHAKE
</pre>

<p>This means that writing or reading to this address has no
affect on the control lines as it would do for the normal
ORA\IRA. Apart from that the two addresses behave identically.</p>
