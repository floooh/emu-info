Revision history:

Revision 1.0: Initial revision (December 1996).
Revision 1.1: Corrected the screen size information (July 1997).
  The 1084 monitor I used did not display all lines.  There are only
  9 blank lines.  Thanks to Timo Raita <timo.raita@iki.fi> for pointing
  this out and for lending his equipment.
  The horizontal resolutions were calculated wrong.
Revision 1.2: Updated the sound frequency formulas (February 1998).
  Levente Hársfalvi made some experiments with the frequencies and
  provided me with revised formulas.

The 6560 pinout and most of the register map were quoted from the
Commodore VIC-20 Programmer's Reference Guide, and the register map
and other parts of this document were enhanced with the results got by
measuring the 6560-101 and 6561-101 chips.  Thanks to Miguel Gordillo
for his help in measuring the NTSC-M screen size.

A: interlace mode (6560-101 only): 0=off, 1=on
   In this mode, the videochip will draw 525 interlaced lines of 65 cycles
   per line, instead of the 261 non-interlaced lines in the normal mode.
   This bit has no effect on the 6561-101.
B: screen origin X (4 pixels granularity)
   6560-101: at 22 chars/line, the suitable range is 1 to 8
	     With 22 chars/line, the value 8 will show only 5 pixels of the
	     rightmost column
   6561-101: at 22 chars/line, the suitable range is 5 to 19
	     With 22 chars/line, the value 20 will show only 5 pixels of the
	     rightmost column

   Both:     If the value B+2*D is greater than CYCLES_PER_LINE-4,
	     the picture will mix up.
             With the value 0, there is some disturbance on the screen bottom.
C: screen origin Y (2 lines granularity)
   6560-101: suitable range is 5 to 130=(261-1)/2,
	     which will display one raster line of text.
   6561-101: suitable range is 5 to 155=312/2-1
   Both:     No wraparound.  The bottom-most line on the screen is 0.
D: number of video columns
   6560 range: 0-26 makes sense, >31 will be interpreted as 31.
   6561-101: 0-29 makes sense, >32 will be interpreted as 32.
E: number of video rows (0-63)
   6560-101 practical range: 0-29; at C=5, >=32 gives 31 3/8
   6561-101 practical range: 0-35; at C=5, >=38 gives 37¾
F: character size (1=8x16, 0=8x8)
G: current raster line ($9004=raster counter b8-b1, $9003 bit 7 = b0)
   Vertical blank is on lines 0 through 27.
H: screen memory location ($9005:7-4 = b13-b10,
                           $9002:7 = b9 of screen and colour memory)
I: character memory location (b13-b10)
* Note that b13 is connected to the inverse of A15 on the Vic-20.
J: light pen X
K: light pen Y
L: paddle X
M: paddle Y
N: bass enable,    R: freq f=Phi2/256/(128-(($900a+1)&127))
O: alto enable,    S: freq f=Phi2/128/(128-(($900b+1)&127))
P: soprano enable, T: freq f=Phi2/64/(128-(($900c+1)&127))
Q: noise enable,   U: freq f=Phi2/32/(128-(($900d+1)&127))
* PAL:  Phi2=4433618/4 Hz
* NTSC: Phi2=14318181/14 Hz
W: auxiliary colour
V: volume control
X: screen colour
Y: reverse mode
Z: border colour

Video timing

As the dot clock on the VIC-I is only 4 times the bus clock, the video
chip has time to read 2 bytes for every 8 pixels it outputs.  All
memory accesses are performed without blocking the processor, using
the interleaved bus.  The basic video timing is very simple.  For
every character the VIC-I is about to display, it first fetches the
character code and colour, then the character appearance (from the
character generator memory).  The character codes are read on every
raster line, thus making every line a "bad line".  When the raster
beam is outside of the text window, the videochip reads from $001c for
most time.  (Some videochips read from $181c instead.)  The address
occasionally varies, but it might also be due to a flaky bus.  (By
reading from unconnected address space, such as $9100-$910f, you can
read the data fetched by the videochip on the previous clock cycle.)
