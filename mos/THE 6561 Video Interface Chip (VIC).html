<h1>THE 6561 Video Interface Chip (VIC)</h1>
<p>

Typed in by Lance Ewing
</p><p>
 Note: There seems to be two different VIC chips that were used in different 
 models of the VIC 20. These are the 6560 and the 6561. Their functionality
 appears to be the same so I will only refer to the 6561.
</p><p>
 The Video Interface Chip, or VIC as it is normally called, is the second
most important silicon chip in the VIC 20 microcomputer. It comes second only
to the 6502A microprocessor itself.
</p><p>
 The VIC is a specially constructed input-output chip (I/O) that has a large
variety of functions but it's major function is, as its name suggests, the
production of the video output signal.
</p><p>
 The VIC appears to the microprocessor, and the user, as an addressable block
of RAM of 16 locations, $9000-$900F. Each of these locations can be filled or
copied, as applies to any other locations that are actually available, with 
the actions of the VIC being dependant on the values that are placed in the 
16 locations.

 The above diagram shows the relationship between the microprocessor and the
VIC as being the normal one of 'microprocessor and memory linked by address
and data buses' but this applies only in system phase-2 time.

 The timing signals in the VIC 20 are somewhat complicated but they can be
explained in quite simple terms.
 The master clokc generates a two phase output at 1.1082 Mhs. The signals
are then used as the 'external time base' for the VIC so that the actions
that take place on the VIC can be timed correctly. The VIC in turn reproduces
the two phase timing signal on one of its output lines which is then used as
the 'external time base' for the 6502A microprocessor. However the final stage
has not as yet been reached as the 6502A microprocessor in its turn reproduces
the timing signals on one of its output lines so that the timing signals can
be used as 'chip select' lines for the RAM chips and I/O chips, but of course
not the VIC.
 Overall, in system phase-2 time the 6502A microprocessor is in communication
with its memory, whilst in system phase-1 time, it is the VIC that is linked
with the memory. The following memory can be addressed by the VIC chip:

   -Video RAM
   -Colour RAM
   -Character RAM/ROM

 The 14 line address line can address 16K of memory. The VIC chip uses 
different addresses to the rest of the computer. The table below illustrates
the differing addresses for the memory blocks the VIC chip can access:

  VIC chip addresses    Ordinary addresses memory

</pre>
<h2>THE VIDEO RAM</h2>

 This is the area of RAM which holds the screen codes of the characters 
currently on the screen. The values poked into screen memory act as pointers
into character memory. They are NOT the ASCII values of the characters. In
the unexpanded VIC 20 the operating system automatically allocates the area
of RAM from $1E00-$1FFF for this purpose. However, when extra RAM is added
to the system to the system at $2000 it becomes necessary to change the
allocation of the video RAM to the area $1000-$11FF. The reason for having to
move the video RAM is simply that the program area must be a continuous block
of RAM. In the unexpanded system the program area is at $1000-$1DFF, with a 
standard 3K RAM pack it is at $0400-$1DFF, and with a standard 8K RAM pack it
is at $1200-$3FFF.
<p>
 The VIC 20 system uses a display of 22 characters per line and has 23 lines.
Therefore the video RAM has to be 506 locations in size. In practice with 512
locations allocated there are always siz locations that are unused.
 The system variable $0288, decimal 648, is used by the operation system to
hold the high byte of the current base address of the video RAM and in an
unexpanded VIC 20 the value in this location is 30 which corresponds to the
base address of $1E00. Interesting effects can be obtained by altering the 
value of this location.


</p><h2>THE COLOUR RAM</h2>
 In an unexpanded VIC 20 the 512 locations in memory from $9600-$97ff are 
used as the colour RAM, whereas if an *K expansion RAM is fitted, the block
$9400-$95ff is used instead. In either case the locations used are only four
bits in size instead of the usual eight bits in size.<p>
 The different locations are used to hold the appropriate foreground colour
for each character area of the display on the TV screen. There is, therefore,
a direct correspondence between the locations of the video RAM, the character
table and the colour RAM.</p><p>
 In the VIC 20 system there are eight foreground colours and each colour has
its own representation for the lower three bits of the locations of colour
RAM.</p><p>
 eg. If the value of the three bits is '000' then the colour for that
character area will be black.
</p><p>

 The colours and their representations are:

</p><pre>   BLACK            000
   WHITE            001
   RED              010
   CYAN             011
   PURPLE           100
   GREEN            101
   BLUE             110
   YELLOW           111

 The fourth bit (bit 3) of each location is used to indicate if multicolour
is to be used (discussed later).
 It is interesting to note that the VIC has a special four line data bus that
links the colour RAM to the VIC itself that is used solely to convey the 
colour data to the VIC.
 
 The address of Colour RAM can be determined by looking at Bit 7 of location
$9002. If this bit is 1, colour memory starts at location 38400. If this bit
is 0, colour memory starts at location 37888. Use the following formula:

      C = 37888 + 4 * ( PEEK ( 36866 ) AND 128 )


THE INTERNAL REGISTERS OF THE VIC

 CR0: $9000 - decimal 36864. Usual value decimal 12.
 A dual function register.
 Function 1: Bit 7 selects insterface scan mode for the TV.
 Function 2: Bits 0-6 determine the distance from the left hand side of the
             TV picture to the first column of characters.
  Note: On most modern TV sets the effect of selecting the interface scan mode
  is to produce a light rippling on the screen.

 CR1: $9001 - decimal 36865. Usual value decimal 38.
 A single function register.
 All the bits of this register are used to determine the distance from the
 top of the TV picture to the first line of characters.

 CR2: $9002 - decimal 36866. Usual value decimal 150.
 A dual function register.
 The first seven bits fo this register determine the number of columns in
 the TV display. Normally this will be the expected value of 22.
 Bit 7 of this register is used to hold the value for line 9 of the address
 for the video RAM. On an unexpanded VIC 20 as the address of the Video
 RAM is $1E00 and therefore this bit 7 is set, however when the video RAM is
 moved to $1000 then bit 7 becomes reset.

 Note: Bit 7 of this register also indicates where the Colour RAM starts. If
 this bit is 1, colour memory starts at location 38400. If this bit is 0,
 colour memory starts at location 37888. Use the following formula:

      C = 37888 + 4 * ( PEEK ( 36866 ) AND 128 )

 CR3: $9003 - decimal 36867. Usual value 174.
 A triple function register.
 Bit 7 holds the lowest bit of TV raster counter and is therefore alternately
 set and reset.
 Bits 1-6 of this register determine the number of rows in the TV display.
 The value of these bits will normally be 23.
 Bit 0 is very special as it controls whether normal sized characters or 
 double sized characters are to be displayed. The normal size for a character
 is 8*8 pixels and is slected by bit 0 being reset, however double sized
 characters, 16*8 pixels, can be selected by having this bit set. 
  The facility for being able to use double sized characters is not very 
 useful on an unexpanded VIC 20 as there is insufficient RAM to define a
 reasonable number of double sized characters.

 CR4: $9004 - 36868. No usual value.
 This register, together with bit 7 of CR3, forms the TV raster counter. On
 a 625 line TV this register will count between 0 and 255, and the whole
 counter between 0 and 311.
 

 CR5: $9005 - 36869. Usual value 240.
 A dual function register.
 Bits 4-7 holds the values of the topmost four address lines for the Video
 RAM and bits 0-3 the corresponding values for the character table.
 Of all these values bits 0 &amp; 7 have a special significance, as whenver
 this bit is set the memory slected will be in 'block 0', i.e. from $0000-
 $1FFF, and when reset in 'block 4', i.e. from $8000-$9FFF.
 In normal operation of a VIC20 this register holds the value 240 decimal
 and this leads to the Video RAM being situated at $1E00 and the character
 table at $8000. These addresses are found as follows:

 Video RAM - bit 7 is set, thereby addressing 'block 0'.
 -Address lines A12, A11, A10, and A9 are all set and the full address is
 $1E00 as A13, A14, and A15 are reset for 'block 0'.

 Character table - bit 3 is reset, thereby addressing 'block 4'.
 -Address lines A12, A11 and A10 are all reset and the full address is
 $8000 as A15 is set and A13 and A14 are reset for 'block 4'.

 CR6: $9006 - 36870. Usual value 0.
 This register is used in conjunction with the light pen and holds the
 horizontal postion.

 CR7: $9007 - 36871. Usual value 1.
 The vertical position of the light pen.

 CR8: $9008 - 36872. Usual value 255.
 The counter for potentiometer 1.

 CR9: $9009 - 36873. Usual value 255.
 The counter for potentiometer 2.

 CRA: $900A - 36874. Usual value 0.
 This register controls 'speaker-1'. Bit 7 is the on/off control bit, whilst
 bits 0-6 select the actual note. Speaker 1 has an alto voice.

 CRB: $900B - 36875. Usual value 0.
 This register controls 'speaker-2', the tenor voice.

 CRC: $900C - 36876. Usual value 0.
 This register controls 'speaker-3', the soprano voice.

 CRD: $900D - 36877. Usual value 0.
 This register controls 'speaker-4', the noise voice.

 CRE: $900E - 36878. Usual value 0.
 A dual purpose register.
 Bits 0-3 form the counter for the volume control of the four speakers.
 When all the bits are reset the volume control is off and when all the bits
 are set the volume control is fully on.
 Bits 4-7 hold the users slection of the auxiliary colour which is only used
 when multicolour is switched on (discussed later).

 CRF: $900F - 36879. Usual value 27.
 This is the main colour selecting register of the VIC and has three distinct
 functions.
 Bits 0-2 are used to hold the border colour. In the VIC 20 there are eight
 colours that can be border colours and these are:

     0 - 000   Black
     1 - 001   White
     2 - 010   Red
     3 - 011   Cyan
     4 - 100   Purple
     5 - 101   Green
     6 - 110   Blue
     7 - 111   Yellow

 These border colours can be selected by putting the required value into the
 bits 0-2 of control register CRF.
 Bit 3 is the reverse field control bit. At any time the state of this bit
 can be changed to reverse the whole display.
 Bits 4-7 hold the background colour for the display. There are 16 possible
 colours and the following tble fives the colours together with their codes.
 Note that these codes are the same for the auxiliary colours as used in the
 multicolour mode.

     0 - 0000   Black
     1 - 0001   White
     2 - 0010   Red
     3 - 0011   Cyan
     4 - 0100   Purple
     5 - 0101   Green
     6 - 0110   Blue
     7 - 0111   Yellow
     8 - 1000   Orange
     9 - 1001   Light orange
    10 - 1010   Pink
    11 - 1011   Light cyan
    12 - 1100   Light purple
    13 - 1101   Light green
    14 - 1110   Light blue
    15 - 1111   Light yellow


CHARACTER TABLE MEMORY

 The standard character table generator of the VIC 20 is a 4K ROM chip that
occupies the block of memory from $8000-$8FFF. This ROM holds the 8x8 matrix
representations of all the characters that can be displayed on the TV screen.
A single character requires 8 locations, each holding 8 bits, in order to
have all its points defined.
 In the VIC 20 system there are a possible 128 different characters and the
first 1K of the 4K ROM holds the straight forward representations for each
character. The second 1K holds the 'inverse' representations.

 8000-83FF    32768-33791   Upper case and graphics
 8400-87FF    33792-34815   Reversed upper case and graphics
 8800-8BFF    34816-35839   Upper and lower case
 8C00-8FFF    35840-36863   Reversed upper and lower case

 In order to get lower case letters it has been necessary to have another
2K of representations of the characters. Once again the first 1K holds the
straight forward representations and the second 1K holds the 'inverted'
representations as shown in the memory map above.
 In the VIC 20 it is possible to change the area of memory that is used to
hold the character table and to change the character representations from
the normal 8x8 matrix to one of 8x16. The second feature is the double
height character mode referred to in the discussion of the VIC registers
themselves.
 The first block of character memory - upper case and graphics - occupies
the ROM locations 32768-34815. The second block - lower and upper case -
occupies the ROM locations 34816-36863.
 Characters are displayed as patterns of dots. Each character position on
the screen is composed of an 8x8 sqaure of dots (pixels). Character memory
contains the information which tells the computer which dots to turn on or
off for a particular character. If a bit is 1, the dot is on (displayed
in character colour). If it is 0, the dot is off (displayed in background
colour). Therefore, to cover 64 dots, each character representation takes
8 bytes of memory.

 eg. The character "A"

           128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1

            0   0   0   1   1   0   0   0               24
            0   0   1   0   0   1   0   0               36
            0   1   0   0   0   0   1   0               66
            0   1   1   1   1   1   1   0              126
            0   1   0   0   0   0   1   0               66
            0   1   0   0   0   0   1   0               66
            0   1   0   0   0   0   1   0               66
            0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0                0

 As mentioned earlier, the screen codes act as pointers into character
memory. The screen code for A is 1. Its 8 bytes of data is therefore stored
at 32768 + (8*1) = 32776. So the values 24, 36, 66, 126, 66, 66, 66, 0 are
stored from 32776 to 32783.
 In general, to find the starting address of the representation of a
character with screen code X use:
  32768 + (8*X)   for character set 1
  34816 + (8*X)   for character set 2
 You can change from one character set to the other from the keyboard by
using the CBM and shift key, or by changing the value of the character
memory pointer - byte 36869. Its value is normally 240 (upper case and
graphics) or 242 (upper case and lower case).


DESIGNING YOUR OWN CHARACTERS

 Since the built in character sets are in ROM you cannot directly change
them. However, as you have seen, the character memory pointer can be
changed. So the secret to using a character set you design yourself is to
change the pointer to point to your character set.

 First, however, you must design your characters. This is usually done with
a piece of graph paper representing the 8x8 matrix. Fill in the squares you
want and then calculate the values as shown above for the character "A".
 It is usual to copy some of the built in character set into RAM and then
change those characters you wish to.


ACCESSING BOTH CUSTOM AND BUILT-IN CHARACTER SETS

 If you have redesigned most of the characters in your custom character set,
displaying understandable messages can be a problem.
 One solution to this makes use of the fact that the VIC chip sees addresses
differently to the rest of the computer. If you place the custom character
set at 7168-7679, then printing RVSON within a string will cause the VIC chip
to access the unreversed character set in ROM when printing that string.
 The reasons for this are as follows:
 The VIC chip can only access 16384 bytes, which it sees as a contiguous
block from 0 to 16383. To it the location of the custom character set is
15360. Since RVS ON sets the high bit of a character's screen code, all
reversed characters have screen codes of 128 up. To access a character with
code 128 the VIC chip goes to location 15360 + (128*8) = 16384. Since the
VIC chip cannot access 16384 the address "overflows" and wraps around to 0,
which the VIC chip sees as the address of the start of character ROM. This
just happens to be the location of the unreversed straight forward, every
day representations.

A: interlace mode (6560-101 only): 0=off, 1=on
   In this mode, the videochip will draw 525 interlaced lines of 65 cycles
   per line, instead of the 261 non-interlaced lines in the normal mode.
   This bit has no effect on the 6561-101.
B: screen origin X (4 pixels granularity)
   6560-101: at 22 chars/line, the suitable range is 1 to 8
             With 22 chars/line, the value 8 will show only 6 pixels of the
             rightmost column
   6561-101: at 22 chars/line, the suitable range is 5 to 19
             With 22 chars/line, the value 20 will show only 5 pixels of the
             rightmost column

   Both:     If the value B+2*D is greater than CYCLES_PER_LINE-4,
             the picture will mix up.
             With the value 0, there is some disturbance on the screen bottom.
C: screen origin Y (2 lines granularity)
   6560-101: suitable range is 14 to 130=(261-1)/2,
             which will display one raster line of text.
   6561-101: suitable range is 14 to 155=312/2-1
   Both:     No wraparound
D: number of video columns
   6560 range: 0-26 makes sense, &gt;31 will be interpreted as 31.
   6561-101: 0-29 makes sense, &gt;32 will be interpreted as 32.
E: number of video rows (0-63)
   6560-101 practical range: 0-29; at C=14, &gt;=30 gives 29 1/8
   6561-101 practical range: 0-35; at C=14, &gt;=36 gives 35.
F: character size (1=8x16, 0=8x8)
G: current raster line ($9004=raster counter b8-b1, $9003 bit 7 = b0)
   Vertical blank is on lines 0 through 27.
H: screen memory location ($9005:7-4 = b13-b10,
                           $9002:7 = b9 of screen and colour memory)
I: character memory location (b13-b10)
* Note that b13 is connected to the inverse of A15 on the Vic-20.
J: light pen X
K: light pen Y
L: paddle X
M: paddle Y
N: bass switch,    R: freq f=Phi2/256/(255-$900a)  NTSC: Phi2=14318181/14 Hz
O: alto switch,    S: freq f=Phi2/128/(255-$900b)  PAL:  Phi2=4433618/4 Hz
P: soprano switch, T: freq f=Phi2/64/(255-$900c)
Q: noise switch,   U: freq f=Phi2/32/(255-$900d)
W: auxiliary colour
V: volume control
X: screen colour
Y: reverse mode
Z: border colour

multicolour (character colour b7=1)
00 = screen colour
01 = character colour
10 = border colour
11 = auxiliary colour

Video timing

As the dot clock on the VIC-I is only 4 times the bus clock, the video
chip has time to read 2 bytes for every 8 pixels it outputs.  All
memory accesses are performed without blocking the processor, using
the interleaved bus.  The basic video timing is very simple.  For
every character the VIC-I is about to display, it first fetches the
character code and colour, then the character appearance (from the
character generator memory).  The character codes are read on every
raster line, thus making every line a "bad line".  When the raster
beam is outside of the text window, the videochip reads from $001c for
most time.  (Some videochips read from $181c instead.)  The address
occasionally varies, but it might also be due to a flaky bus.  (By
reading from unconnected address space, such as $9100-$910f, you can
read the data fetched by the videochip on the previous clock cycle.)
