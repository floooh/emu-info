                            Introduction

Pac-Man and Pengo are two games from the early 1980's.  Pac-Man came
out in 1980, and Pengo in 1982.  Pengo, was released by SEGA, as
opposed to Pac-Man, which was released by Namco/Midway.  Many variants
of both machines also exist.  There are over 30 different versions and
bootlegs of Pac-Man, and on top of that, it is one of the most abundant
and recognizable arcade video games.  There are also quite a few games
that work directly on Pac-Man hardware with a simple ROM swap.  Eyes
Ms. Pacman, Crush Roller, are amongst the list.  However, you cannot
just take a Pac-Man romset and drop it into Pengo, or vice versa.

So, why group them together?

The hardware in Pengo is a superset of the hardware in Pac-Man.  That
is to say that Pengo hardware can do everything that Pac-Man hardware
can do, plus a little more.  For example, Pengo supports twice as many
graphics sets as Pac-Man.  So you can see, that if you were to just
start writing a program to be run on Pac-Man hardware, it should be
trivial to get it working on Pengo hardware.  Well, it is, and it
isn't, let me explain;

Although the two machines posess similar hardware, they're not at the
same places in memory.  Think of it like on your PC if you had two
parallel ports, and in one, you have your scanner, and in the other you
have your Zip drive.  If you were to bring your copy of windows and
hardware over to another machine, it might have its parallel ports
swapped, and then windows might get confused, cause it'd be telling
scanner commands to the zip drive and vice-versa.

We have the same problem here.

For example, both machines posess joysticks.  Pac-Man is wired such
that the order is UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN,  whereas Pengo is wired such
that the order is UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  But that's just the tip of
the iceberg.  Pac-Man only has half as much ROM "program" space as
Pengo, so you have to limit how big your program gets to half of what
Pengo is capable of if you want to be able to use it on both. And also
as well, your RAM and Video Hardware are at different locations in
memory on the two machines... but i'll get into that a bit later.

What I have done is to make a common environment so that you can write
a program (or game) once.  Then just by changing one line in a
Makefile, it will be built for one or the other.  That is to say that I
have taken the hardware, and abstracted the specifics out so that you,
as a programmer, needn't know exactly where things are.  You can just
use the RAM, or check to see if the user has moved right, etc.   I've
successfully built two different applications, and had it run
identically on emulated Pac-Man and Pengo hardware.


----------------------------------------
                   Sprite Based Graphics

If you've done any programming for modern-day video hardware at all,
then you're probably familiar with bitmapped raster graphics.  Sprite
based graphics are a little different.  Instead of having a pixel by
pixel resolution, you have a sprite by sprite based resolution.   It is
akin to text mode on a PC, where you have just 255 characters to work
with.  You can change the font, but you only get one font per screen.
Some text-mode demos for the PC, like 'Textro' by OTM, actually build
a new font for every image they want to draw.  On the other hand, you
could do things like ANSI graphics, which is using the standard textmode
font to display low resolution images on your screen.

This is essentially what you have to work with on Pengo and Pac-Man
hardware.  (Crush Roller, Rally X, Arabian, and a few others either use
the same or similar hardware.)  About the only addition is that there
is some extra hardware that lets you also display floating sprites over
this tiled display at a pixel by pixel resolution.

So what is the resolution we have here? 

The hardware displays a 28 by 32 tile of 8x8 pixel sprites..  Every
character on the display can be using a different color set, and every
character itself is a four-color character.  Background sprites are 8x8
pixels, Floating sprites are 16x16 pixels.  Background sprites can only
be displayed in that 28x32 grid, whereas floating sprites can be anywhere
in the 224x256 display.  ( 8*28 x 8*32 ) = ( 224 x 256 )

The background sprites and the Floating sprites are stored in different
roms, so you can have completely unrelated sprites in the background
or floating over it in the foreground.  However, they both reference
the same color palettes.  Pac-Man allows for only one set of each to
be available. (One background sprite set and one floating sprite set.)
Pengo hardware allows you to switch between two sets of each. (two
background sprite sets, and two floating sprite sets).  These can be
switched between at runtime.


----------------------------------------
                          The Memory Map

So now you're wondering, how do I program for this?  How do I draw
something on the background, and move some floating sprites over it?
Well, it's actually a lot easier than you might think.

All of the hardware is memory mapped.  That is to say that the control
registers for the hardware are at specific locations in memory.  Unlike a
PC, where all of the 'ports' require IO calls, you can just write out to a
bit of memory to do stuff.  On PC's, the Parallel port requires reading in
from a port 0x37f, or writing out to that port to read or write the bits.
This hardware would just have that port at a specific location in memory,
so you can just read or write it like any other variable.  

Let's look at the Pengo memory map:

	Memory Location		What it is

	0x0000 - 0x7fff		Program ROM
	0x8000 - 0x83ff		Video RAM
	0x8400 - 0x87ff		Color RAM
	0x8800 - 0x8fff		RAM

	0x9000			Dip Switch 1
	0x9040			Dip Switch 0
	0x9080			Control Input 1
	0x90c0			Control Input 0

	etc...

If you look at this, you will notice that you have 32 kilobytes of ROM
space, 1 kilobyte of video ram, 1 kilobyte of color ram, and 2 kilobytes
of RAM.  (Incidently, this is quite a bit more than the Atari 2600 VCS,
which had _NO_ video ram, and 128 bytes of ram.  The VCS was the most
popular home machine when Pengo was out in the arcades.)

So, you can see that you don't have much elbowroom to work with.


So what is this Video RAM and Color RAM?   Is the Color RAM where the
palettes go?

Nope.  Palettes are stored elsewhere.  I'll get to those in a bit.

The Video RAM is the space in memory where you setup the background tiles
of sprites.  This is almost the same as drawing with ANSI graphics in
MS-DOS.  The Video RAM is where you would write sprites to be displayed.
For example, at coordinate (4,5) place the letter "J".  The Color RAM is
where you choose what colors the sprites in the video ram get displayed
with.  Again, at coordinate (4,5) set the color "Green".   If you were
to do both of those, you would have placed a Green "J" at coordinate
(4,5) on the screen.  You can modify one and leave the other alone.
So you could constantly change the colors of coordinate (4,5), and the
"J" will appear to cycle through colors, or flash or what have you.

One clever thing you can do is that you can display the same sprite with
different colors.  Think about Pac-Man...  You have four ghosts chasing
your little yellow circle dude around the maze.  One Red, Pink, Aqua, and
Orange.  All four use the same sprite graphics, but with different colors.

The resolution of the palette is a set of four colors.  That is to
say that each palette entry consists of a collection of four colors.
Each sprite (for this hardware) is a four-color sprite.  I'll get into
color more in a bit...


----------------------------------------
                Floating Sprite Hardware

So what are 'floating sprites' then?

This hardware also has an extra chip for adding sprites over the
background tiles at arbitrary locations.  I call these "floating sprites",
since they float over the background, independant of it. You can have
8 floating sprites in Pac-Man, but only 6 in Pengo.  Similarly to the
Video and Color RAM, you specify the sprite and its color.  But along
with these, you also specify its location on the screen, as well as
whether or not you want to flip it in the x and y directions.

This is how they got the single Pac-Man sprite to be facing left, right
up and down without having to have too many repeats of the sprites.
You just need one pointing up, and one pointing to the right.  The rest
is done by mirroring the sprite in hardware using the x and y flip.

So how do you use it?

This is easily done, not as easily said. heh.  As with everything else,
the hardware is the same between Pac-Man and Pengo, but is in a different
memory locations on both.  There are two important bits to look for. 
The first is the base registers, the second is the coordinate registers.

The base registers contain the sprite number, x/y flip, and color.
These are all stored in two bytes for each floating sprite supported.
(Pengo supports 6, Pac-Man supports 8 floating sprites.)  For every
sprite are these consecutive bytes.  The two bytes for floating sprite
0 are at the base and base +1 addresses.  The two bytes for floating
sprite 1 is at the base+2 and base+3 address, and so on.

   Base Registers:

   Byte 0:                   Byte 1:
   [7][6][5][4][3][2][1][0]  [7][6][5][4][3][2][1][0]
   [ Sprite number  ][x][y]  [         color        ]


It really is as simple as you think it is.  Just shove the number for
the sprite you want in bits 2-7 of byte 0, set bits 1 and 0 on byte 0 if 
you want to flip the sprite horizontally or vertically.  Also, just 
drop the color you want the sprite to be in Byte 1.  

The color?  Single color?

Well,  not really.  It's an entry into a palette, where each entry is
a set of four colors.  All sprites on this hardware are four color 
sprites.  Color 0 is used to signify transparency on the sprite.  When 
the sprite is a background tile (which i'll get into later) then color 0
is not transparent anymore.  More about color in a bit...

The other registers you'll need to use are the coordinate registers. 
Similarly to the base registers, these are pairs of bytes, arranged
sequencially.  First the X value, then the Y value for sprite 0, then
the x and y values for sprite 1 and so on.

Byte 0 is the X value for sprite 0.  Byte 1 is the Y value for sprite 0.
Byte 2 is the X value for sprite 1.  Byte 3 is the Y value for sprite 1.
And so on...

The coordinate is the location on the screen where the upper left of
the sprite is positioned on the screen.  The coordinates start on the
bottom right of the screen.  The first coordinate that the 16x16 sprite
is completely visible is at 31x16.  If it's lower than that, it starts
appearing at the top of the screen.  Be aware however that the sprite
does not appear on the bottom 16 or top 16 pixels of the display.
These are in the horizontally arranged background tiles which will be
explained later in the Video RAM Layout section.

Horizontally, however, there is a section off the right and left sides of
the screen where the sprites are invisible.   That is to say that you can
scroll a sprite off the left or the right 


                      vertical wrap is visible
         (239,256) +----------------------------+ (31,256)
                   |                            |
       horizontal  ~                            ~  horizontal
   wrap is hidden  ~                            ~  wrap is hidden
                   |                            |
          (239,16) +----------------------------+ (31,16)
                      vertical wrap is visible


----------------------------------------
                      Collsion Detection

If you're going to have floating sprites, you're probably going to need
some way to tell when they overlap.  This is called "Collsion Detection",
where you're detecting when one sprite "collides" with another sprite,
or a wall in your maze, or the like.

There are many ways to do this, some require many cycles of processor time,
some require very few, some are very accurate, and some are very 'messy'.

For most applications, a quick, messy algorithm is really about all you
will need.  (Besides, it gives you more time for your game code.)


	if (sprite_x % (sprite width)  == sprite_N_x % (sprite width))
	{
	    /* they're about in the same column... check the row now */
	    if (sprite_y % (sprite height)  == sprite_N_y % (sprite height))
	    {
		/* the sprite has collided with sprite_N. */

		/* insert appropriate code here. */
	    }
	}


It's not the most accurate routine, but it will work for most games.


----------------------------------------
                                   Color

There is no mechanism or ability to change the color or palettes once
the ROMS have been created.  The next section will describe how the
palette roms are layed out, so that you can modify them if you like.

There are two different roms here.  The first is the Palette ROM.  
This one contains all of the individual colors we may wish to use.
The second is the Lookup ROM.  This rom contains collections of 
four-color entries which are used to color the sprites.  

----------------------------------------
                      Palette ROM Layout

One byte specifies a color.  It specifies an RGB value.  Three bits for 
each red and green, and two bits for blue.  (Your eye and video display 
systems are weak in the blue region, so this is not a problem at all.)

The Palette ROM is just a collection of 32 1 byte entries, specifying
all of the colors we may wish to use in our lookup table entries. (Both
Pac-Man and Pengo have 32 entries available to them.)

For example, if you're going to be using Red multiple times, you don't
need to have multiple Red entries.  Just one.  The lookup rom just 
references that specific "red" entry in the Palette ROM for each
instance of "red" that it needs.


for each entry:
	bits 7,6 - blue
	bits 5-3 - green
	bits 2-0 - red

	ie:
		Red   =  %0000 0111  = 0x07
		Green =  %0011 1000  = 0x38
		Blue  =  %1100 0000  = 0xc0

		Yel   =  %0011 1111  = 0x3f
		Cyan  =  %1111 1000  = 0xf8
		pur   =  %1100 0111  = 0xc7

	etc...

byte1 is color0  
byte2 is color1
etc


----------------------------------------
                       Lookup ROM Layout

This is just a collection of four-byte sets, specifying each of the
color entries available for the Color RAM or Floating Sprite hardware.
You will reference one of these color entries for each sprite you want
to put to the screen.

Quite simply, they specify what color 0, 1, 2, and 3 on the sprite
maps to on the palette.  They are just stored raw in the rom. ie:

[byte 0] [byte 1] [byte 2] [byte 3]  = color entry 0.
[byte 4] [byte 5] [byte 6] [byte 7]  = color entry 1.

These reference back into the Palette ROM.  So if the palette rom
had the following colors as bytes 0 thru 7:

	   0     1     2       3     4     5      6       7
	[black][red][yellow][green][cyan][blue][purple][white]

And the lookup ROM had: (starting at the beginning of the Lookup ROM)

    0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00  /* color entry 0:  black black black black */
    0x00 0x01 0x05 0x07  /* color entry 1:  black red   blue  white */
    0x00 0x01 0x04 0x07  /* color entry 2:  black red   cyan  white */

This means that if you were to use color 0 on a character or sprite,
it would all be black.  If you used color 1, then the four colors used
to paint that sprite or character on the screen are black, red, blue,
and white.


----------------------------------------
                              Color ROMS

Pacman and Pengo have different capabilties for color.  Both have support
for 32 colors, but Pengo can have four times as many lookup entries.

	Type	File	Entries		What it means

Pacman	palette	.7f	32x1 byte	32 discrete colors max
	lookup	.4a	64x4 byte	64 four-color entries

Pengo	palette	.078	32x1 byte	32 discrete colors max
	lookup	.088	256x4 byte	256 four-color entries


----------------------------------------
                        Video RAM Layout

The layout of video ram (and color ram -- they're identically layed out) 
is kind of strange.  It basically looks like this:

    A     55 54 53 52 51 50 49 48
    B     63 62 61 60 59 58 57 56
    C           40 32 24 16
    D           41 33 25 17
    E           42 34 26 18
    F           43 35 27 19
    G           44 36 28 20
    H           45 37 29 21
    I           46 38 30 22
    J           47 39 31 23
    K     07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
    L     15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08


NOTE: This is just an example, but it shows the real memory layout.
      The example here is shown as being 4x10 resolution, when the 
      real hardware has a 28x36 resolution.

That is to say at offset of 55 into the video ram is the upper left
corner, and an offset of 08 os the lower right corner.  But it doesn't
stop there.  The four sprites in each of the corners (55, 54, 63, 62),
(49, 48, 57, 56), (07, 06, 15, 14), and (01, 00, 09, 08) don't show up on
the display.  That's how we get a width of 4 in this example, and not 8,
as you might think.  I've no idea why they decided to lay out the memory
in this fashion, but run with it.

In the real hardware, the top two and bottom two rows (A, B, K, L)
are 32 bytes long, instead of the 8 bytes in this example.  Also in the
real hardware, the vertical rows (C thru J) also 32 bytes long, instead 
of the 8 bytes in this example.  There are also 28 of them, instead of 4 
in this example.  


NOTE: So that you know, here are how the offsets in this example 
      corrolate to real hardware:

	this example	real hardware
	    00		   0x0000
	    08		   0x0020
	    48		   0x03C0
	    56		   0x03E0

One thing that is easy to remember is that for the vertical section,
the upper left corner is at an offset of 900 (decimal) on the Pacman
and Pengo hardware.  On our example here, it's 40.  So to write
out a string of text, first find the origin of the text:

	offset = TOP_CORNER - ( x * (HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN) ) + y

    so, for the above example:

 	      TOP_CORNER = 40
	HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN = 8

    or for real hardware:

	      TOP_CORNER = 900
	HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN = 32


And then from there, every character to the right is at -HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN
(-32) from the previous character.  So a function to put a text string
out to the display might look like this:

	#define HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN 32
	#define TOP_CORNER       900

	putstring(int x, int y, char * text, int color)
	{
	    int pos = 0;
	    int loc = TOP_CORNER - ( x * HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN ) + y;

	    while (text[pos] != '\0')
	    {
		videobuffer[pos] = text[pos];
		colorbuffer[pos] = color;
		pos++;
		loc -= HEIGHT_OF_COLUMN;
	    }
	}

Of course, you realize that this does not take into accout the topmost
two lines, nor does it do the bottommost two lines.  Those are just
stored right-to-left in the video memory.  You can figure out how to
put text out to those yourself. ;)


----------------------------------------
                          Watchdog Timer 

Another thing you will have to do, is to occasionally reset the watchdog
timer.  The watchdog timer sits out there, constantly counting upwards.
When it reaches its limit, it will reset the machine.  This is imperative
to have on this kind of hardware, for if some wierd unexpected thing
occurs, and the machine is "hung", it must be able to reset itself
without the arcade owner's intervention.

The counter itself is triggered off of the VBLANK, or "vertical blanking"
interrupt.  This gets triggered 60 times a second, or every 16.7mSec, when
the screen is done being drawn by the monitor.  When the count reaches 16,
the four bit counter (74ls161 at 9c on the Pac-Man board) will "carry",
and will reset the machine.  So you basically need to clear the watchdog
timer quicker than four times a second otherwise it will reset itself
on you.  All you need to do is to just put a lot of these in your code:

in c:
	char * watchdog;
	watchdog = 0x50c0;	/* pac-man watchdog address */
				/* use 0x9070 for pengo */

	*watchdog = 0;		/* clear the watchdog timer */

in Z80 asm:
	.equ	watch, 0x50c0	; pac-man watchdog address
				; use 0x9070 for pengo 
	
	xor	a
	ld	(watch),a	; clear the watchdog timer


----------------------------------------
               Timing and Initialization

There are two methods to do timing in the hardware.  The first is a simple
busy loop, the second watches the vertical blank to judge actual time.

The first, a busy loop, is very simple, and can be quite inaccurate.
It is a simple for loop that counts to some arbitrary value, which after
experimentation and testing, will delay the required amount of time.

It looks like this:


	/* wait for about three to four seconds... */
        for ( x=0 ; x<10000 ; x++)
        {
            /* put code here to check the inputs */
        }


The problem with this, is that depending on what you do in the loop, will
change the amount of time it sits waiting.  Obviously, nothing else in
the system can happen while this loop is executing, so you should at least
reset the watchdog timer, and count coin drops while this is happening.


The other method is to setup an IRQ routine, and handle timing off of
a real clock source.  Unfortunately, there is nothing like a realtime
clock in the pac-man hardware... but we have something close.  There is an
interrupt that happens between every frame that gets drawn on the screen.
(When the vertical blank, or VBLANK happens.)  This happens 60 times
per second, like clockwork, if you forgive the pun.

So how do you use this timer?  Well, it's a two step process.  You should
look at the 'rst' opcode for the Z80 to start off with:

	;restart location
	rst	0x0000		; C7    rst 0
	rst	0x0008		; CF    rst 1
	rst	0x0010		; D7    rst 2
	rst	0x0018		; DF    rst 3
	rst	0x0020		; E7    rst 4
	rst	0x0028		; EF    rst 5
	rst	0x0030		; F7    rst 6
	rst	0x0038		; FF    rst 7

Those are all of the 'rst' opcodes.  So, what are these, and what do they
have to do with anything?  The 'rst' opcode is a single byte opcode that
does the equivalent to a jump ('jp') or a call ('call') method to go to
a subroutine.  The 'jp' and 'call' opcodes require three bytes, rather
than just one for 'rst'.  The limitation is that there are only 8 valid
'rst' opcodes, which jump to eight specific locations.  The 8 locations
are 0x0000, 0x0008, 0x0010, and so on.  They are 8 bytes apart, so there
is space in there for a 'jp' to the handling routine for that 'rst' call.

When the system starts up, it does the equivalent to "rst 0x0000", and
starts at memory location 0x0000.  From there, there should be a jump
to your initialization routine.

That initialization routine should first set up any timers, then any other
system initializaion, and then call your own game routine.  As would be
expected, when setting up interrupts, you should turn off interrupts.
Then re-enable them after the setup is complete.


    irqen = 0x5000		; pac-man irq enable register

    .init:
	di			; disable processor interrupts
	ld      sp, #.stack	; setup the stack pointer.
	im	1		; set interrupt mode 1
				; all interrupts go through vector 0x0038

        ld      a, #0xff	; fill register 'a' with 0xff
        out     (0x00), a	; do an 'out' to port 0x00 with data 0xff
        ld      a, #0x01	; fill register 'a' with 0x01
        ld      (irqen), a	; enable the external interrupt mechanism

        ei			; enable processor interrupts
	call	your_routine	; call your main game/app routine


If you notice in there, we do an 'out' to port 0x00 with 0xff.  If we
look above, the opcde "0xff" is the "rst 0x38" opcode.  This is setting
the VBLANK interrupt request routine (IRQ), to opcode 0xff, meaning
that when the VBLANK interrupt occurs, it will do the equivalent of the
"rst 0x38" opcode.  Your IRQ routine should be at 0x0038 in the memory
space of the processor.  For Pac-Man, this memory space is in the first
ROM.  Of the three Interrupt modes, mode 1 is the only one we need to
care about.  It sends all interrupts (not including the NMI) through
our routine at 0x0038.  (For Mode 0, it will vector off to whatever
data is on the databuss, Mode 2 will do something similar, where some
data is passed in and the vector is computed.)

Since this IRQ routine is the last one in the list, we can just start
the IRQ code at 0x0038 in the rom.  The following sample routine just
increments a counter variable (a 16 bit (two byte) value).  At normal
operation, it takes about 18 minutes for this variable to overflow,
and loop around.  This should not be a problem.


    timer = 0x4c00		; timer variable -- at base of RAM

    .irq:
        di			; disable processor interrupts
        push    af		; store aside register 'af' to the stack
        push    bc		; store aside register 'bc' to the stack
        xor     a		; a = 0
        ld      (irqen), a	; disable the external interrupt mechanism
       
        ld      bc, (timer)	; bc = timer
        inc     bc		; bc++
        ld      (timer), bc	; timer = bc

				; do any other code here if you like
       
        ld      a, #1		; a = 1
        ld      (irqen), a	; enable the external interrupt mechanism
       
        pop     bc		; restore register 'bc' from the stack
        pop     af		; restore register 'af' from the stack
        ei			; enable processor interrupts
        reti			; return from interrupt routine


This is about as simple as you can get.  You can actually put some
logic in here for registering inputs and coin drops if you like, but
this should get it on its feet.  Just be sure to save and restore any
registers you may use.  You also need to be sure that this routine does
not take longer than 1/60th of a second to execute, or your main code
will never get a chance to execute... or the IRQ routine will re-enter
itself, and things will die a horrible, miserable death.

If you want to see how this is used in practice, look in the 0crt.asm
file which is the runtime Small C compiler.  The one that is available
from my development environment has been modified from the generic one
(which is also there) so that all of this is already done for you.
Also done already in that file, is that all of these bits are in their
proper locations.

Once all of that is set up, you will need to use it in your program.  All
you need to do for a two second delay, for example, is the following:


	int wait_until;

	/* set the final end time to be:
		 now + (60 ticks per second) * (2 seconds)
	*/
	wait_until = timer + (60 * 2);

	/* wait for it to happen */
	while (timer <= wait_until)
	{
	    reset_watchdog_timer();
	    check_for_user_input();
	    /* do other appropriate things here */
	}


That's it.  If you look in my "hello" source, you can see how I use the
timer to animate the sprites at a specific rate.


This method is a bit more complex to get it working, but yields much
more accurate results.  Once you have the mechanism set up, it's easy
to re-use it for all of your projects.


----------------------------------------
                 Control and Dipswitches

Since all of the hardware is all memory mapped, we can just look out
into memory at the dipswitches and input ports.  Pengo and Pac-Man have
them located at different places in memory, but the technique is the
same for both.

Most, if not all of the control lines for these games are normally closed
That is to say that if you look at the data stored in IN0 at the Player 1
Joystick Up bit, it will be 1 when the joystick isn't "up", and it will
be 0 when the user pushes the joystick upwards.  This is true for the 
coin slots as well.  

Dipswitches are usually in banks of 8.  If you just read the byte at 
the hardware's memory location for the dipswitch, you will see the state
of all 8 switches.  "OFF" switches set that bit to 0.  "ON" switches
will set that bit to 1.


----------------------------------------
                          Sound Hardware

The sound hardware is actually pretty easy to work with.  There are a
set of registers, each for a single 'voice'.  Each voice is independant
of the other ones.  The hardware supports three such voices.

  Register Name			Pac Address(es)         Pengo Address(es)

  Voice 1 Waveform		0x5045			0x9005
  Voice 1 Volume		0x5055			0x9015
  Voice 1 Frequency		0x5050 - 0x5054		0x9011 - 0x9013
  Voice 1 Accumulator		0x5040 - 0x5044		n/a

  Voice 2 Waveform		0x504A			0x900A
  Voice 2 Volume		0x505A			0x901A
  Voice 2 Frequency		0x5056 - 0x5059		0x9016 - 0x9018
  Voice 2 Accumulator		0x5046 - 0x5049		n/a

  Voice 3 Waveform		0x504F			0x900F
  Voice 3 Volume		0x505F			0x901F
  Voice 3 Frequency		0x505B - 0x505E		0x901B - 0X901D
  Voice 3 Accumulator		0x504B - 0x504E		n/a

Each of these only look at the bottom nibble at that location, so
instead of 256 possible values for each address, it instead is only
16.

  == Waveform ==

    This is a selector to choose which 'waveform' or tonal quality will
    be played on the voice.  There are only 8 waveforms to select from,
    so really, only the bottom three bits of the bottom nibble are looked
    at.  Here's my best guess at what each of them sound like:

    Waveform Number	low 			high

	0x00		Synth Bass (smooth)	smooth tone
	0x01		Idling Engine		higher tone
	0x02		Tank Engine		sawtoothy tone
	0x03		Noisy Bass		bell-like noise
	0x04		Pingy Bass		electric razor
	0x05		Chirpy 			almost silent
	0x06		almost silent		smooth nice tone
	0x07		brappy 			droning high pitch

    ...Your milage may vary.  Try out Dave Widel's test rom to experiment
    with these. (http://www.widel.com)


  == Frequency ==

    For all voices, there are four registers which control the tone.
    Voice 0 has an extra register which adds in ``very low''
    frequencies, below the other standard four.  These, as with the
    other sound registers, only use the bottom nibble of each byte.
    Each byte is a complete octave/suboctave of the next/previous
    byte.

    The following table shows how these line up.  The addresses used in
    this example are for Pac-Man.

    Voice	0x5050	0x5051	0x5052	0x5053	0x5054
	1	0x0f	0x0f	0x0f	0x0f	0x0f

    Voice		0x5056	0x5057	0x5058	0x5054
	2		0x0f	0x0f	0x0f	0x0f	

    Voice		0x505B	0x505C	0x505D	0x505E
	3		0x0f	0x0f	0x0f	0x0f

    The way that this works is that from 0x00 to 0x0F in register 0x505C
    is a complete octave. For example, to get a tone halfway between
    0x01 and 0x02 in register 0x505C, you would put an 0x07 in 0x505B.
    It should be noted that in the typical scale, there are 12 halftones
    per octave, while here, there are 16 steps per octave.

    Pengo only has three registers for frequency for each of the voices,
    as opposed to Pac-Man's 5, 4, and 4 registers for each of the
    voices.

    Here is a table of one octave As you can see, the least significant
    bits are in the base register, with the more significant bits being
    in the offset registers:

	Note	freg	freg+1	freg+2	freg+3
	 C-1	0d	05	01	00	
	 C#1	03	07	01	00
	 D-1	09	08	01	00
	 D#1	0a	0a	01	00
	 E-1	0f	0b	01	00
	 F-1	05	0d	01	00
	 F#1	06	0f	01	00
	 G-1	07	01	02	00
	 G#1	08	03	02	00
	 A-1	08	05	02	00
	 A#1	09	07	02	00
	 B-1	0a	09	02	00

    You could store these table lookups as either one word, or four
    bytes.  The trade off is between speed of execution and rom
    space.  For example, you could store "F-1" as chars:

    char_f1:
	.byte	0x05, 0x0d, 0x01, 0x00

    or as a word:

    word_f1:
	.word	0x01d5

    That is a decision that you, as the programmer, will have to
    figure out for yourself.  Decoding from the word requires much
    more code.  Instead of a single reference per frequency register,
    you need to do a bunch of shifts.  You can probably get away
    with not doing the bitmasking after the shift, since the sound
    hardware probably ignores that anyway.

in c:
	char * v1_frequency;

        v1_frequency = 0x5050; /* 0x9010 for Pengo */

	*(v1_frequency+0) = (word_f1) & 0x000f;  /* play F-1, 0x01d5 */
	*(v1_frequency+1) = (word_f1 >> 0x04) & 0x0f;
	*(v1_frequency+2) = (word_f1 >> 0x08) & 0x0f;
	*(v1_frequency+3) = (word_f1 >> 0x0C) & 0x0f;

in Z80 asm:
	; this code is left as an exercise for the user.  ;)


    Anyway, to set the hardware up to play the note, "F-1", you
    would do it this way:

in c:
        char * v1_frequency;

        v1_frequency = 0x5050; /* 0x9010 for Pengo */

	*(v1_frequency+0) = 0x05;  /* play F-1, 0x01d5 */
	*(v1_frequency+1) = 0x0d;
	*(v1_frequency+2) = 0x01;
	*(v1_frequency+3) = 0x00;

in Z80 asm:
        .equ    v1_freq,	0x5050  ; 0x9010 for Pengo

	ld 	hl, v1_freq	; hl = v1_freq
	ld	a, 0x05
	ld	(hl), a		; v1_freq = 0x05
	inc	hl
	ld	a, 0x0d
	ld	(hl), a		; v1_freq+1 = 0x0d
	inc	hl
	ld	a, 0x01
	ld	(hl), a		; v1_freq+2 = 0x01
	inc	hl
	xor	a
	ld	(hl), a		; v1_freq+3 = 0x00

    Obviously, there are other things you need to do to play the sound,
    like set the waveform, as well as enable the sound hardware itself.
    All of that is covered in the following text.


  == Volume ==

    The volume is perhaps the simplest of the sound registers.  It
    basically controls the volume of the tone generated by that voice.
    There are 16 steps to the volume, starting with the voice silent at
    0x00, and ending with the voice at maximum volume at 0x0F.


  == Accumulator ==

    Pac-Man also adds some registers which are used by the sound
    hardware and should not be touched by your programs.  These are the
    "accumulator" registers.  They do not exist on Pengo hardware, so
    don't expect them to be there.

  == Sound Enable Register ==

    It should also be noted that there is a register that will mute all
    of the channels.  It enables and disables all of the voices
    simultaneously.  You should never assume that this is set or unset
    when the machine starts up.  Set it to be the way you want it to
    be. Generally, the first thing you do at power up should be to
    disable sound, just in case the machine's sound hardware is filled
    with junk data.

	Pac-Man Sound Enable Register:	0x50C0
	Pengo Sound Enable Register:	0x9041



It is as easy to use as you might expect.  All that you need to do is
to write out values to the different sound register locations to make sound.
To get a tone to come out, you need to basically:
    
    * enable the sound on the hardware
    * set the tone of a voice
    * set the frequency of a voice
    * set the volume of a voice

If any of those are 0x00, you will not hear any tone from the
voice(s).  Here is some example code that makes a noise:

in c:
        char * snd_en;		/* sound enable */
        char * v1_volume;
        char * v1_waveform;
        char * v1_frequency2;

        snd_en	      = 0x5001; /* 0x9041 for Pengo */
        v1_volume     = 0x5055; /* 0x9015 for Pengo */
        v1_waveform   = 0x5045; /* 0x9005 for Pengo */
        v1_frequency2 = 0x5052; /* 0x9012 for Pengo */

        *snd_en        = 1;	/* enable audio */
        *v1_volume     = 0x0F;	/* Set the volume to maximum */
        *v1_waveform   = 0x02;	/* switch to waveform 3 */
	*v1_frequency2 = 0x0E;  /* set one of the frequency registers */

in Z80 asm:
        .equ    snd_en,		0x5001  ; 0x9041 for Pengo
        .equ    v1_volume,	0x5055  ; 0x9015 for Pengo
        .equ    v1_waveform,	0x5045  ; 0x9005 for Pengo
        .equ    v1_freq2,	0x5052  ; 0x9012 for Pengo

        ld      a, #1		; a = 1
        ld      (snd_en),a	; enable audio

        ld      a, #0x0f	; a = 0x0f
        ld      (v1_volume),a	; Set the volume to maximum
        ld      a, #0x02	; a = 0x02
        ld      (v1_waveform),a	; switch to waveform 3 
        ld      a, #0x0E	; a = 0x0E
        ld      (v1_freq2),a	; set one of the frequency registers

You can also change these from a timer interrupt, or somesuch to play
music in the background of your program, reading simply from a table of
predefined values.  You can also do interesting effects by varying the
volume (tremolo) or frequency (vibrato) at a rapid rate.


----------------------------------------
                        Sound ROM Layout

The Pac sound rom (82s126.1m) is a 256 byte rom, similar to the color
roms mentioned previously in this document.  The rom contains the 8
waveforms which you select with the waveform register above.

The data in the Pengo roms can be seen in the following PNG images:

    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pengowaves01.png
    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pengowaves23.png
    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pengowaves45.png
    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pengowaves67.png

The data in the Pac roms can be seen in the following PNG images:

    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pacwaves01.png
    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pacwaves23.png
    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pacwaves45.png
    http://umlautllama.com/projects/pacdocs/waves/pacwaves67.png

The waveforms are each 32 one-byte samples, with data only in the
lower nibble.  Each sample can contain a value from 0 to 0x0f.  To
play different wave shapes, just convert them to be 32 samples
long, and only ranging in amplitude from 0 to 15.

For example, an imperfect triangle wave (starts at 0x01, ramps up
to 0x0F, then ramps back down to 0x1) would be stored as:

	; triangle wave, similar to Pacman's waveform 6
	.byte	0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08
	.byte	0x08, 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0B, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x0E, 0x0F
	.byte	0x0F, 0x0E, 0x0D, 0x0C, 0x0B, 0x0A, 0x09, 0x08
	.byte	0x08, 0x07, 0x06, 0x05, 0x04, 0x03, 0x02, 0x01

Then immediately following that is the next waveform.  Here's a 
sine wave as a second example.

	; sine wave, just similar to Pac-Man's waveform 0
	.byte	0x07, 0x09, 0x0a, 0x0b, 0x0c, 0x0d, 0x0d, 0x0e
	.byte	0x0e, 0x0e, 0x0d, 0x0d, 0x0c, 0x0b, 0x0a, 0x09
	.byte	0x07, 0x05, 0x04, 0x03, 0x02, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00
	.byte	0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05

Notice how it crosses the zero point at the beginning and middle
of the waveform.

If the waveform repeats twice in the 32 bytes of the sample, then
the frequencies played back will be double what the frequency
registers are set at.



----------------------------------------
                         Other Registers

I'm not entirey sure about most of these.  I'm also not sure if some
of these registers (ie: palette bank selector, color lookup bank) are
even emulated.   I also know that the Watchdog Counter is important,
but i'm not sure what do do with it, as I have found no information if
the watchdog circuitry is even emulated in MAME.  So the problem here is
that if the watchdog is not reset properly, your programs may work fine
on the emulator, but might just sit and reset itself on real hardware.


interrupt enable
----------------
    Enables and disables the interrupt circuitry.

    set to 0 to disable interrupts
    set to 1 to enable interrupts

flip screen
-----------
    Set to 1:  The background video buffer is rendered vertically.
	       This _DOES_NOT_ change the floating sprites at all. 

    Set to 0:  The background video buffer is rendered normally.

    This is useful for "Cocktail" use, where you have to flip the screen
    vertically for player 2 to play the game right-side-up.

sprite bank
-----------
    (Pengo Only)
    Set to 0: BOTH the background and floating sprite banks to bank 0
    Set to 1: BOTH the background and floating sprite banks to bank 1

start lamps
-----------
    Since Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man both don't use start lamps, this
    is really kind of unclear.  Generally with games, there sometimes
    are lights inside of the start buttons.  "Asteroids" is an
    example of this.  There are no known releases of Pac-Man with
    start button lights.

    Due to this, the following is a complete guess.
    Set to 0: the lamp associated with that register turns off
    Set to 1: the lamp associated with that register lights up

coin counters
-------------
    not totally sure
    set to 1, then 0 I imagine to toggle a pulse for the coin counter

coin lockout
------------
    I'm not sure about this one. Pac-Man doesn't have coin lockout
    hardware or circuitry.

    Generally, coin lockout mechanisms keep the user from adding
    in more coins once the game is in play.  This keeps the game
    from having to keep track of new quarter drops during gameplay.
    Most Pac-Man machines do not have this mechanism, and thus
    should watch for coin drops all of the time.

watchdog reset
--------------
    On the real hardware, this needs to be reset to zero frequently to 
    prevent the hardware from automatically resetting itself.  Just set
    to zero a lot, and you should be fine. (Or clip the circuit from 
    your board. hehe.)  This needs to be cleared less than every 15
    frames to keep the game from resetting on you.

palette bank selector
---------------------
    not sure

color lookup bank
-----------------
    not sure
